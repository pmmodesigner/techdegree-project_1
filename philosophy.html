          <h2>Three design criteria&hellip;</h2>
          <p>Still a young designer, I've got a lifetime of learning in the craft of visual communication. However, I've discovered that I arrive to my work with a set of design criteria to yield <strong>powerful</strong> design work:</p>
          <p>I firmly believe that compelling visual communication occurs when it is clear, accessible, and impressive. <em>Clear</em> to immediately relay its message; so it should be <strong>simple</strong>. <em>Accessible</em> to make it relatable and understood; so it should be <strong>human</strong>. And <em>impressive</em> to engender a spirit of wonderment; so it should be <strong>artful</strong>.</p>
          <p>These three criteria have guided me to create design work that I believe communicates effectively and even viscerally.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Design is simple.</h3>
          <p>Every once in a while, I get a feeling that everything has become too much: a constant hum of a furnace, a spew of photos and drawings on a refrigerator, or a super sweet latte—not even potable.</p>
          <p>I surmise that supersaturation isn't desired.</p>
          <p>I am convinced that a plethora of words and objects in a design layout wouldn't allow me the ability to effortlessly gather the message being presented to me.</p>
          <p>Simplicity isn't a means of getting rid of something; it is a means of leaving the perfect amount of something&mdash;all to avoid the <em>too much</em> and to elevate the remaining into elegance.</P>
          <hr>
          <h3>Design is human.</h3>
          <p>Humans have developed language­—a way to effectively communicate.</p>
          <p>However, I propose that symbols have a greater emotional pull than language: symbols provide illustrations of human processes. For example, they give insight as to how a tribe hunted and survived via wall paintings, they demand auto drivers to stop via red octagons, and they even unify whole belief systems in a few straightforward shapes via pictograms.</p>
          <p>These ideas are easily conveyed without the mechanical syntax and lengthiness of language. Being mindful of regional cultural ideas, they allow elaborate concepts to become highly accesible to all persons.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Design is artful.</h3>
          <p>I see art as being a creative and expressive experience. An experience derived from an artist's intention and a viewer's interpretation. And due to this dichotomy of artist intention versus viewer interpretation, it is a way to connect at a profound level by holding a dialogue with a silent, unknown other.</p>
          <p>It is at this dialogue where truths may be murmured; where emotions may be stirred; where divides may be bridged; and where minds may be marveled. Pieces of artwork comprise a network of all of the creations and expressions made by mankind. They become the cultural identity of our human race.</p>
          <p>This makes it imperative that all of my works should be made with craft and consideration for my viewers' interpretation.</p>
